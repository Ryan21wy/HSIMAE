## ‚ú® Highlights
### Masked HSI Modeling with Large-Scale Pretraining
The HSIMAE was pretrained by a large-scale HSI dataset, named HyspecNet-11k, then directly finetuned on four target classification datasets.

### Multi-Scale PCA for Features Extract
To address these distributional shifts caused by the different spectral resolutions and spectral ranges between hyperspectral sensors, a MS-PCA was used to extract the multi-scale features of HSI spectra and transform the raw spectra into fixed-length features.

### Dual-branch finetuning to leverage unlabeled data of target dataset
Dual-branch finetuning framework was proposed by using an extra unlabeled branch to further adapted the model to the distributions of the target dataset and suppressed the overfitting issue.
